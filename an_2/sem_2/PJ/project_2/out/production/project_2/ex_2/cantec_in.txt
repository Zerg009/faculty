Turn your mental prison into a maze
Turn the maze into a place where you're safe
Right now stepping on the graves even
Everything will wither and decay
But the energy will stay
Every day, early, late, every second even

Turn away for nothing, just in case
A sensation but it's strange
In a way everything is a secret even
Call myself a vessel, not a name
Call a taxi in the rain
Take a plane out of space to confess, I need it
